This repository is a storehouse of interesting numerical experiments in physics and beyond.

## Moire-one-dim
March 2018
I was investigation the tight-binding spectrum of a set of two one-dimensional lattices such that one of them is slightly displaced from the first lattice.

## Multi-particle-spectrum
May 2018
Consider N distinguishable particles in a box. I want to see how the energy states for these particles look like.
This experiment has been motivated from Sakurai, Modern Quantum Mechanics, Chapter 4, Problem 1

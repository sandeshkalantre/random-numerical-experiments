This repository is a storehouse of interesting numerical experiments in physics and beyond.

## Moire-one-dim
March 2018
I was investigation the tight-binding spectrum of a set of two one-dimensional lattices such that one of them is slightly displaced from the first lattice.

## Multi-particle-spectrum
May 2018
Consider N distinguishable particles in a box. I want to see how the energy states for these particles look like.
This experiment has been motivated from Sakurai, Modern Quantum Mechanics, Chapter 4, Problem 1

## Largest Eigenvalue Eigenvector
May 2018
I implemented an idea for finding the largest eigenvector by repeatedly applying H on a random vector for various standard Hamiltonians. The GS also can be found in a similar manner by using H^-1 instead or via Gaussian elimination during the iteration step.

This allows a nice visualization of wavefunctions of standard Hamiltonians.

## Eigenvalue Repeat
May 2018
I carried this gendaken numerical experiment, what happens if we take eigenvalues of the matrix which diagonalizes a certain matrix and keep repeating this process? The eigenvalues all lie on the unit circle after the first step.

I could not see any pattern in real, imag parts or the phase of the eigenvalues.
There is non-trivial phase distribution for each of the eigenvalues; I could find any reason for that. The only lesson here was that the eigenvalues are NOT uniformly distributed on the unit circle.

An interesting question is, for what matrices does this procedure have fixed points?
